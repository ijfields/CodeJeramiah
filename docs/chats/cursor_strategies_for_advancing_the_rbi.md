@ai15_onefile_save_mine.py was the start of this project, It was the start of the RBI system 
Research - find videos, pdg, txt stategies then wrote them to @strategies_event/ and code a backtest using backtsting.py and put it in @bt_code_event/ the backested needed much manual changes to get them to just run/compile.

Backest - we want to use lumibot

Implement - We will run the straegt in demo the live mode
There are so many new advacemnts in ai, it could be a good time to refactor or rewrite. for instance google has low cost models anf chatgpt seems to be the most powerful and its free for now. also claude has subagents. the original idea was that the assistant(agent) would create the statey for the ai coder to implement. a new agen woulde code the backtest thena another agent would ron the backests, if errors were generated then that would be giben to the coding agent to fix.

here is a link to the an example with subagent definitions. @https://github.com/contains-studio/agents 

I didnt want to continue with backtesting.py because its not good for options. ive switched to lumibot but i have not createdv a profiyable strategy yet

Give me 3 ideas for moving forawrd.
give me three options for moving forward.

you nay ask questions for clarity.

I looked at your current pipeline in `ai15_onefile_save_mine.py`, which creates a “strategy creator” assistant that writes to `Open-AI-Assistants/strategies_event` and a “backtest coder” assistant that writes to `Open-AI-Assistants/bt_code_event`, then loops over ideas. These are the key points tying research → strategy instructions → code output:

```203:217:ai15_onefile_save_mine.py
def create_and_run_data_analysis(trading_idea):
    filename = 'strategy_assistant.txt'
    data_analysis_output = create_and_run_assistant(
        name='Strategy Creator AI',
        instructions='Create a trading strategy based on the given trading idea.',
        model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13',
        content=f"Create a trading strategy using {trading_idea}. ... DO NOT CODE",
        filename=filename
    )
    if data_analysis_output:
        filename_base = generate_filename(data_analysis_output, 'txt').split('.')[0]
        save_output_to_file(data_analysis_output, data_analysis_output,os.path.join(out_path,'strategies_event'),'txt') 
        return data_analysis_output, filename_base
```

```222:236:ai15_onefile_save_mine.py
def create_and_run_backtest(strategy_output, trading_idea, filename_base):
    filename = 'backtest_assistant.txt'
    backtest_output = create_and_run_assistant(
        name='Backtest Coder AI',
        instructions='Code a backtest for the provided trading strategy using backtesting.py, output only the code of the backtest',
        model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13',
        content=f"Strategy Output: {strategy_output}. Please use backtesting.py to code this strategy. ...",
        filename=filename
    )
    if backtest_output:
        save_output_to_file(backtest_output, strategy_output, os.path.join(out_path,'bt_code_event'),'py')
```

Given you want Lumibot for backtesting and paper/live trading, plus multi-agent “research → write → code → run → fix” with cheaper models where possible and subagents like in the example repo, here are three concrete options to move forward.

### Option 1: Minimal viable migration (fastest)
- **Goal**: Keep your current one-file flow, swap only the codegen target and runner to Lumibot.
- **Changes**
  - Update the “Backtest Coder AI” instructions to emit a Lumibot `Strategy` subclass and a small runner that can do both historical backtest and paper-trading with your broker keys.
  - Add a tiny local runner that imports the generated file and invokes: historical backtest, paper-trading demo (sandbox), and logs PnL/metrics to a simple CSV.
  - Add a “Backtest Runner AI” pass that only receives runtime errors and diffs, and regenerates the Lumibot code until it compiles and runs.
  - Use model routing: cheap model for research/summary (e.g., Gemini Flash), stronger model for code/fixes (e.g., GPT-4o), optional Claude for agent roles if needed.
- **Pros**: Fastest, least refactor, preserves your current directories and flow.
- **Cons**: Single-file orchestration; error handling loop is still brittle; limited memory/sharing between runs.

### Option 2: Modular multi-agent refactor with subagents (balanced)
- **Goal**: Rebuild your pipeline as a small set of subagents with clear contracts inspired by the subagent pattern in the example repo [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents).
- **Agents**
  - **Researcher**: Finds/summarizes sources; stores notes and references.
  - **Strategy Architect**: Produces precise, machine-targetable spec for a strategy (inputs/indicators/entries/exits/risk).
  - **Lumibot Coder**: Generates a Lumibot `Strategy` and runner (backtest + paper/live toggles).
  - **Backtest Runner**: Executes backtests over fixed datasets; aggregates metrics; stores JSON results.
  - **Fixer**: Takes exceptions/tracebacks and metrics shortfalls and patches the code.
  - **Evaluator/Selector**: Compares strategies, enforces guardrails (drawdown, Sharpe, win-rate), picks candidates for demo/live.
  - **Deployer**: Starts/stops demo mode; handles rollovers and daily schedule.
- **Infrastructure**
  - Light orchestrator that passes artifacts via files or a small local “runs/” folder with JSON specs and results.
  - A shared “strategy spec” JSON schema that the Architect writes and the Coder consumes.
  - Model routing: set per-agent defaults; e.g., Researcher on cheaper model, Coder/Fixer on GPT-4o, Evaluator on small model.
- **Pros**: Clear roles, easier debugging, extensible to Claude subagents; better automated error→fix loop.
- **Cons**: A bit more lift up front than Option 1.

### Option 3: Full workflow rewrite with a DAG and evaluation harness (most robust)
- **Goal**: A fully reproducible DAG/pipeline with datasets, metrics, regression tests, and promotion gates for demo/live.
- **Components**
  - A “Strategy Pack” folder per strategy: `spec.json`, `lumibot_strategy.py`, `runner.py`, `results/*.json`.
  - Datasets fixtures (SPY, QQQ, selected tickers/options) and configurable time windows per test.
  - An evaluation harness that runs N combinations per strategy, computes metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, MDD, hit rate, exposure), and logs to a dashboard.
  - Automated promotion: only strategies passing thresholds get scheduled to paper-trading; live promotion requires sustained results and human approval.
  - Multi-provider LLM router with cost caps and caching.
- **Pros**: Scalable, measurable, safe; supports rapid iteration and avoids regressions.
- **Cons**: Heaviest initial build; best for a longer-term platform.

### Quick notes specific to Lumibot
- Have the Coder agent always output:
  - A Lumibot `Strategy` subclass.
  - A `runner.py` that can run historical backtests and switch to paper/live via env vars.
  - A small config block (broker keys, symbols, timeframes) read from `.env`.
  - A standard set of metrics returned as JSON so the Evaluator can score.
- Add a canonical template for these files so the Coder agent fills in well-defined placeholders.

### Clarifying questions
- Which broker(s) and markets will you use with Lumibot for paper/live (e.g., IBKR, Alpaca, Tradier for options)?
- Do you want to stick with your current OpenAI Assistants approach, or switch to a light custom orchestrator with subagents (as in [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents))?
- Are you okay standardizing on a “strategy spec” JSON that the Architect produces and the Coder consumes?
- Cost preferences: OK to use a mix (Gemini Flash for research, GPT-4o for code/fixes, Claude for planning), or prefer OpenAI-only?

- If you pick an option, I’ll implement the scaffolding and migrate your current flow to Lumibot with an automatic run→error→fix loop.

- I can start with Option 1 right now and deliver a working Lumibot generator and runner with your existing directories.

```python
def create_and_run_data_analysis(trading_idea):
    filename = 'strategy_assistant.txt'
    data_analysis_output = create_and_run_assistant(
        name='Strategy Creator AI',
        instructions='Create a trading strategy based on the given trading idea.',
        model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13',
        content=f"Create a trading strategy using {trading_idea}. ... DO NOT CODE",
        filename=filename
    )
    if data_analysis_output:
        filename_base = generate_filename(data_analysis_output, 'txt').split('.')[0]
        save_output_to_file(data_analysis_output, data_analysis_output,os.path.join(out_path,'strategies_event'),'txt') 
        return data_analysis_output, filename_base
```

```python
def create_and_run_backtest(strategy_output, trading_idea, filename_base):
    filename = 'backtest_assistant.txt'
    backtest_output = create_and_run_assistant(
        name='Backtest Coder AI',
        instructions='Code a backtest for the provided trading strategy using backtesting.py, output only the code of the backtest',
        model='gpt-4o-2024-05-13',
        content=f"Strategy Output: {strategy_output}. Please use backtesting.py to code this strategy. ...",
        filename=filename
    )
    if backtest_output:
        save_output_to_file(backtest_output, strategy_output, os.path.join(out_path,'bt_code_event'),'py')
```

I'm startting with tradier, options, futures. Im adding tradelocker/trend markets for fores. i think sub agenst might be easier.  regarding straefy spec, yes. ok to mix and gpt5 is free in cursor right now. @Guidance for creating a backtesting app has info regarding the bigger picture, for inscance pehaps we woul want to have a fuction librar thet has buy.sell/put/call sence all strategies wil be variations or paramerided versions, but that may not be a good idea. i just noticed openai has an agen sdk. i think i want to go with for long term. i have already started new repository based on @options_backtest_clean/ also, @StrategyTempate.py was my starter basically to show that i used a credenial file for keys and to determine backtesting/demo/live mode. context77 is available to look up documentation

**Cursor**

I reviewed your preferences (Tradier options/futures, adding TradeLocker/Trend for forex, subagents, JSON strategy spec, long-term with Agent SDK, new repo seeded from `options_backtest_clean`, using `StrategyTemplate.py` pattern). Below are three concrete paths tailored to that.

### Option 1: Subagent file-orchestrated system (balanced, quickest to scale)
- Roles
  - Researcher → finds/summarizes sources
  - Strategy Architect → writes a strict `strategy_spec.json`
  - Lumibot Coder → emits `lumibot_strategy.py` + `runner.py` from the spec
  - Backtest Runner → executes, writes logs/metrics/tearsheet/trades HTML
  - Fixer → consumes exceptions/metrics deltas and edits code
  - Evaluator → gates to demo/live based on KPIs
  - Deployer → toggles backtesting/demo/live via `IS_BACKTESTING`/env
- Storage/IO
  - Use simple “runs/” folders: `runs/{uuid}/{spec, code, results, logs}`
  - Keep per-strategy “packs” under `strategies/{slug}/`
- Broker/data
  - Start with Lumibot + Tradier for options; add a simple `BrokerAdapter` interface so later TradeLocker/Trend can plug in for forex
- Pros: Clear contracts; simple to debug; easy to extend; aligns with your repo and `StrategyTemplate.py`
- Cons: You own orchestration code (lightweight though)

### Option 2: OpenAI Agent SDK pipeline with subagents (long‑term, more integrated)
- Use OpenAI Agent SDK to register each agent above as a tool-aware subagent; coordinator agent calls them in sequence with artifacts persisted to disk
- Benefits
  - Built-in memory, tool-calling, function routing; cheaper models for Researcher/Evaluator; strongest model for Coder/Fixer
  - Natural fit for your multi-agent vision; easy to add more roles
- Considerations
  - You'll still want a thin artifact layer on disk for reproducibility
  - Cost controls, caching, and model routing policies should be set
- Reference: contains-studio subagent pattern for role definitions and flows [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)

### Option 3: Full pipeline with DAG + evaluation harness (heaviest, most robust)
- Add a DAG runner (e.g., lightweight queue or orchestrator) to run: spec → code → backtest grid → metrics → fix loops → promotion
- Standardize datasets and grid configs; regression tests prevent metric drift
- Auto-promotion: pass KPI thresholds for N periods → schedule demo; human confirmation for live
- Pros: Most reliable for scaled experimentation and live safety
- Cons: More upfront work

### Strategy spec (recommended JSON contract)
Keep everything parametric; legs and signals are the core. Example:

```json
{
  "name": "OTM Put Credit Spread",
  "universe": ["SPY"],
  "timeframe": "1D",
  "entry": {
    "signal_logic": [
      {"type": "indicator", "name": "VIX", "operator": "<", "value": 20},
      {"type": "indicator", "name": "SMA", "params": {"length": 20}, "operator": ">", "target": "SMA_50"}
    ],
    "day_rules": {"dow_in": [1,2,3,4,5], "enter_time": "15:30:00"}
  },
  "legs": [
    {"asset": "option", "symbol": "SPY", "right": "PUT", "side": "SELL", "qty": 1, "dte": 7, "delta": -0.15},
    {"asset": "option", "symbol": "SPY", "right": "PUT", "side": "BUY",  "qty": 1, "dte": 7, "delta": -0.05}
  ],
  "risk": {"max_spread_risk_pct": 1.0, "portfolio_risk_cap_pct": 10, "stop_loss_pct": 50, "take_profit_pct": 50},
  "roll": {"roll_on": ["assignment_risk","gamma_risk"], "days_before_expiry": 1},
  "position_sizing": {"per_trade_risk_pct": 1.0, "max_concurrent": 3},
  "backtest": {"start": "2023-03-01", "end": "2024-02-08", "benchmark": "SPY"},
  "broker": {"name": "tradier", "account_type": "paper"},
  "metrics_thresholds": {"max_drawdown_pct": 20, "sharpe_min": 0.8, "win_rate_min": 55}
}
```

- Why not a generic “buy/sell/put/call” function library as a core abstraction? Do it, but centered on a “leg builder” and “position factory” that consumes the spec above:
  - `build_option_leg(spec_leg)`, `build_vertical_spread(legs)`, `place_multi_leg_order(legs, debit_or_credit, limit_price_logic)`
  - Keep broker-specific details inside the `BrokerAdapter`

### Repo layout recommendation (works for all options)
```
options_backtest_clean/
  agents/
    researcher.py
    architect.py
    coder_lumibot.py
    runner.py
    fixer.py
    evaluator.py
    deployer.py
  strategies/
    my_strategy_slug/
      strategy_spec.json
      lumibot_strategy.py
      runner.py
      results/
      logs/
  libs/
    brokers/
      tradier_adapter.py
      forex_tradelocker_adapter.py  # later
    lumibot_helpers/
      leg_builder.py
      order_factories.py
      metrics.py
      io.py
  credentials.py
  .env
  scripts/
  results/
  logs/
  data/
```

### How this meshes with `StrategyTemplate.py`
- Keep `IS_BACKTESTING` switch and credentials file pattern
- Coder agent fills a class derived from your template with:
  - `parameters` from `strategy_spec.json`
  - Position construction via `leg_builder` and `order_factories`
  - Standard backtest/demo/live runner using env vars
- Backtest Runner writes `settings.json`, `tearsheet.csv/html`, `trades.csv/html`, `stats.csv` and attaches them to the run folder

### Model routing
- Researcher/Evaluator: cheaper model
- Architect: mid-tier
- Coder/Fixer: premium (GPT‑4o/GPT‑5 in Cursor)
- Optional Claude subagent for planning or test generation

### Immediate next steps
- Decide: Option 1 (subagents with file orchestrator) vs Option 2 (Agent SDK subagents). Given your long-term note, I recommend Option 2; we can still mirror Option 1’s file artifacts.
- I’ll scaffold:
  - `agents/*` stubs
  - `libs/lumibot_helpers/*` with `leg_builder.py`, `order_factories.py`, `metrics.py`, `io.py`
  - `strategies/{example}/strategy_spec.json` and generated `lumibot_strategy.py` skeleton matching `StrategyTemplate.py`
  - `BrokerAdapter` for Tradier options; placeholders for futures/forex
- Add a first “spec → code → backtest → results” run wired to your `logs/` outputs, including `trades.html`

### Clarifications
- Futures via Tradier: which symbols/exchanges do you want first? If Tradier’s futures coverage is limited, should we plan IBKR/Tradovate adapters?
- Forex with TradeLocker/Trend: do you have API docs/keys ready for adapter work?
- Minimum KPI thresholds for promotion to demo/live (defaults OK?): max DD 20%, Sharpe ≥ 0.8, win rate ≥ 55%, sample trades ≥ 100?

Reference: subagent role pattern inspiration [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)

Status update: I aligned your preferences with three concrete implementation paths and proposed a shared strategy spec, repo layout, and immediate steps. Ready to scaffold Option 2 unless you prefer a different path.

- Three tailored options: file-orchestrated subagents, Agent SDK subagents, or full DAG pipeline
- Provided JSON `strategy_spec` contract and repo structure that fits `StrategyTemplate.py`
- Proposed `BrokerAdapter` and `leg_builder/order_factories` to keep strategies parametric and broker-agnostic
- Suggested model routing and first-run deliverables; awaiting confirmation on Option 2 and broker specifics

**User**

also we will be using polygion io flat files for backesting. This a work in progress, @ZRCE_Strategy_Second_Chance.py , how woul this work with the stragegy spec?

---

**Cursor**

Quick status: I skimmed `ZRCE_Strategy_Second_Chance.py` and your `StrategyTemplate.py`. Below is a tight mapping of how a JSON strategy spec would drive ZRCE using Polygon flat files during backtests.

### How to wire ZRCE to a strategy_spec with Polygon flat files
- Use a JSON spec as the single source of truth. The runner loads it, passes `spec.parameters` into `ZRCEStrategySecondChance(parameters=...)`, and selects a local data backend if `spec.data.source == "polygon_flat"`.
- Your current class already supports much via `parameters` and `_get_option_price_from_parquet`. Add 2 light hooks:
  - A local-equities reader for underlying minute/5-minute data during backtests (parallel to your options parquet reader).
  - A tiny “LocalPolygonParquetBacktesting” data adapter (or a strategy-level helper that intercepts `get_historical_prices` when `IS_BACKTESTING` and `data.source == polygon_flat`).

### Example strategy_spec for ZRCE Second Chance

### Field → code mapping
- spec.trading.symbol → `parameters["symbol"]`
- spec.trading.trading_hours → `parameters["trading_hours"]` (use your `_coerce_time` to parse strings)
- spec.entry.zone_drawing_time → `parameters["zone_drawing_time"]`
- spec.entry.min_volume_threshold → `parameters["min_volume_threshold"]`
- spec.entry.second_chance.enabled/relaxed_volume_ratio → `parameters["enable_second_chance"]` / `parameters["relaxed_criteria_second_attempt"]`
- spec.trading.zone_buffer → `parameters["zone_buffer"]`
- spec.trading.max_trades_per_day → `parameters["max_trades_per_day"]`
- spec.trading.prefer_0dte → `parameters["prefer_0dte"]`
- spec.risk_exits.* → `parameters` keys you already read (`trailing_stop_percentage`, `trail_activation_profit_pct`, `break_even_buffer_pct`, `fixed_stop_loss_pct`, `tp_mode`, `tp_fixed_pct`, `partial_tp_enabled`, `first_tp_pct`, `first_tp_size`, `second_tp_pct`, `max_hold_minutes`)
- spec.sizing.position_size → `parameters["position_size"]`
- spec.data.source == polygon_flat → route price/history reads to parquet helpers in backtests
- spec.backtest.* → passed to your runner (start/end/cash/fees), not into `parameters`

### Minimal glue you need
- Data hook for equities (like your options parquet):
  - Provide `get_historical_prices_local(asset, n, interval)` that loads from `equities_min` or `equities_5min` parquet, resamples if needed, returns a DataFrame compatible with your current use (columns open/high/low/close/volume, index datetime).
  - During backtests and `data.source == polygon_flat`, intercept `get_historical_prices` calls inside ZRCE to use the local loader; or implement a small `LocalPolygonParquetBacktesting` data provider and call `Strategy.backtest(LocalPolygonParquetBacktesting, ...)`.
- Runner reads spec and instantiates:
  - `ZRCEStrategySecondChance(parameters=spec_to_parameters(spec))`
  - Pass backtest start/end/cash/fees; set `IS_BACKTESTING=True` and a `DATA_ROOT` env for parquet base path.

### Where subagents fit
- Architect writes this spec.
- Coder either selects your hand-written `ZRCEStrategySecondChance` when `entry.logic == "zrce_second_chance"` or generates a derived class that only overrides constants via `parameters`.
- Runner executes, Evaluator scores, Fixer patches parameters/logic as needed. Subagent role pattern can follow the approach from [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents).

Questions
- Do your equities parquet files follow a stable minute/5-minute schema as in the spec? If not, share their columns so I align the loader.
- For futures/forex, will we also have local flat files initially, or pull via broker APIs?

- Mapped ZRCE to a JSON spec (including data paths for Polygon flat files) and showed direct parameter bindings.
- Listed the two small hooks needed: local equities reader and (optional) local backtesting data adapter.
- Noted how subagents use the spec and your existing class without heavy refactors.

how would this work with the strategy spec@GhettoSpreadOptionsTradingStrategyInstructions_06_18_24_17_42.txt

### How “Ghetto Spread” maps to a strategy spec
Below is a compact JSON spec that captures the Ghetto Spread flow: buy an initial call (or put), then convert to a vertical debit spread by selling the farther OTM leg when a conversion trigger hits. It’s designed to drive a Lumibot implementation and Polygon flat-file backtesting, and it aligns with your subagent flow (Architect → Coder → Runner → Evaluator) as in the subagent pattern from [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents).

```

### Field → behavior
- Initial leg: buy ATM/OTM call (or put variant) via `delta_target` and `dte_days`.
- Conversion: when underlying or premium hits threshold, sell OTM call same expiration to form the vertical; enforce `min_net_debit_remaining >= 0.01` and `spread_width`.
- Risk: max loss equals initial debit; parameterized TP/SL; time exit and pre-expiry close.
- Filters: basic liquidity/IV filters.
- Data: use Polygon flat files during backtests; live/paper gets broker prices.

### Implementation notes in Lumibot
- Parameters mapping: fill `parameters` from spec: symbol, dte, delta, spread_width, triggers, TP/SL, time exit, slippage.
- Execution state machine:
  - Phase A (Entry): place buy for long call.
  - Phase B (Conversion): on trigger, sell short call (same expiry, target width or delta).
  - Phase C (Exit): TP/SL/time/expiry rules; close both legs if needed.
- Orders: if multi-leg ticket isn’t available, submit sequential orders; track the two `Asset` legs and net debit internally.
- Backtests with Polygon flats: reuse your existing parquet option-price helper and add an equities-minute loader (as discussed for ZRCE).
- Outputs: write `settings.json`, `tearsheet.*`, `trades.*`, `stats.csv` under per-run folder.

### Optional extensions
- Support put variant by switching `right: PUT` and bullish→bearish triggers.
- Add “profit threshold based on max spread value” to set dynamic TP.
- Add gamma/theta time-of-day guardrails.

### Clarifications
- OK to enforce spread width strictly (fixed dollar) vs nearest strikes available from chains?
- Minimum acceptable OI/volume per leg for live placement with Tradier?
- For conversion trigger, prefer underlying move, option premium move, or either?

- Proposed a JSON strategy spec for Ghetto Spread that captures staged legging, conversion triggers, risk, and data integration with Polygon flat files.
- Mapped spec fields to Lumibot behavior and suggested a simple state machine for entry→conversion→exit.
- Cited subagent reference for role pattern: [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents).

answers to questions
i want to start with tradier tradelocker/trend because i have support. @kirkland_signals.csv contains some of the tickers and for futures, i want to also use micro mini and up for futures. i/ want the system to ba acessible for every level. yes i have docs and keys for tradelocker/trend i did some prelimnary work here: @Integrating TradeLocker with Lumibot for Forex Tra.md 
suggested kpi is good. also, note that lumibot gerates many logs when backtesting. i have not used live. @Guidance for creating a backtesting app has more info about the logs.  also you can review @logs and use context77.
your suggested kpi's are fine. should we create a spec or prd that we use to start a new project?
should we pick up from the stategity instructions in @strategies_event/ or start over. the the strategies i was looking at are in strat_ideas*.txt

incoprate @BIG_IDEA/ in our plan. i think this can be a big disrupter.

**Cursor**

Quick status: Got your answers and constraints. I’ll propose a concrete path that uses subagents, a spec-first approach, and supports Tradier (options/futures) plus TradeLocker/Trend (forex), with Polygon flat files for backtests.

### Direct answers
- Should we create a spec or PRD to start a new project? — Yes, both:
  - PRD: product scope, roles, KPIs, UX, environments.
  - Strategy Spec: machine-readable JSON schema that all strategies use (symbols, legs, triggers, risk, sizing, data source, broker).
- Start from `strategies_event/` or from `strat_ideas*.txt`? — Use `strat_ideas*.txt` as the canonical sources; mine `strategies_event/` to seed structured specs, but don’t code directly from those unstructured instructions.
- Incorporate `BIG_IDEA/`? — Yes: align roadmap, positioning, and “disruptor” vision into PRD and milestones.

### Three options to move forward (tailored)
- Option A (recommended): OpenAI Agent SDK subagents + spec-first
  - Subagents: Researcher → Architect (writes spec) → Coder (Lumibot) → Runner (backtest) → Evaluator (KPIs) → Fixer → Deployer.
  - Persist artifacts per-run; route cheap/strong models per role.
  - Reference subagent pattern: [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents).
- Option B: File-orchestrated subagents (lighter)
  - Same roles, simple file passing; later migrate to Agent SDK.
- Option C: Full DAG + evaluation harness (heavier, most robust)
  - Grid backtests, regression tests, promotion gates to demo/live.

### What to build first (MVP, 2-week target)
- New repo scaffold (based on `options_backtest_clean`) with:
  - `agents/` (roles above), `strategies/{slug}/`, `libs/` (leg_builder, order_factories, metrics, io, broker_adapters).
  - `credentials.py` and `.env` with `IS_BACKTESTING` and broker keys.
- Strategy Spec v1 (works for options/forex/futures):
  - Core: universe, timeframe, entry logic, legs, triggers, risk/exit, sizing, data, broker, backtest window, outputs.
  - Instruments: include multipliers and contract mapping (micros like MES, MNQ, M2K, MGC).
  - Data: `polygon_flat` paths for equities/options minute and 5-minute; later add futures/forex feeds.
- Two seed strategies from your library, spec-driven:
  - ZRCE Second Chance (SPY options, already aligns well with parameters).
  - Ghetto Spread (staged debit spread with conversion trigger).
- Brokers/data
  - Tradier adapter: options (now), futures (plan micros; confirm Tradier coverage; if gaps, plan fallback adapter).
  - TradeLocker/Trend adapter for forex (use your docs/keys).
  - Polygon flat-file readers for minute/5-min equities and options (hook into backtests).
- Logs and KPIs
  - Ingest `_settings.json`, `_tearsheet.csv/html`, `_trades.csv/html`, `_stats.csv` into a `runs/` table.
  - KPIs (approved): max DD <= 20%, Sharpe ≥ 0.8, win rate ≥ 55%, trades ≥ 100.
  - UI: run list, drill-down to trades and tearsheets; promotion gate to demo.

### Immediate action items
- Create Strategy Spec v1 (JSON) + a short Spec Guide.
- Stand up subagent stubs (Agent SDK) wired to write/read per-run artifacts.
- Implement `polygon_flat` loaders and unify logging format (include `trades.html`).
- Convert ZRCE and Ghetto Spread into specs; generate Lumibot classes using your `StrategyTemplate.py` conventions.
- Add `kirkland_signals.csv` parser for a “Signals” strategy family (forex first, then futures).

### Clarifications
- Confirm initial futures broker path for micros: Tradier only, or should we plan a second adapter (e.g., IBKR/Tradovate) if Tradier coverage is thin?
- For forex via TradeLocker/Trend, do you prefer a single adapter abstraction or two separate adapters initially?

- We’ll proceed with Option A (Agent SDK subagents), seed two strategies from your library, wire Polygon flat-file backtests and logs ingestion, and expose KPIs/promotion in the UI. Reference subagent pattern: [contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents).

- Created a concise plan: use subagents with a JSON Strategy Spec, start from `strat_ideas*.txt` (mine `strategies_event/`), scaffold a new repo around your `StrategyTemplate.py`, add Polygon flat-file loaders, and ingest Lumibot logs including `trades.html`.

tradier seens good for futures: @https://tradier.com/individuals/pricing/futures-margins  just make a note for ibkr for future enhancements.

I think single adapter. Trendmarket is the broker, Tradelocker proveses the api...am i missing something?

proceeding with option a will still allow us to scale into option C correct?


---

**Cursor**

Brief status: Acknowledged Tradier futures plan, adapter question, and scaling path. Here are crisp answers and next steps.

### Answers
- Tradier futures: Viable, but note it’s marked “coming soon” with posted margins; plan adapter readiness with a feature flag and test as access becomes available. See margins table and notice on their site: [Tradier futures margins](https://tradier.com/individuals/pricing/futures-margins).
- Single adapter for forex: Yes. Build one `TradeLockerAdapter` (API platform) with broker config set to TrendMarkets. You’re not missing anything—TradeLocker is the execution/data API; TrendMarkets is the broker account behind it. Keep room for minor broker-specific differences (auth endpoints, symbol routing).
- Option A → Option C: Yes. The spec-first artifacts (strategy_spec, code, results) and subagent roles are the same. You can scale Option A into a DAG/evaluation harness (Option C) without rework.

### Implementation notes
- Add “IBKR adapter” to the backlog for futures and options as a future enhancement.
- For TradeLocker/Trend: one adapter; parametrize environment/server and account type (demo/live).
- For Tradier futures: gate with config until your account is enabled; add micro symbols (MES/MNQ/M2K/MGC, etc.) to the instrument map early.

### Immediate next steps
- Lock Option A (Agent SDK subagents).
- Finalize Strategy Spec v1 (JSON) and seed with ZRCE Second Chance + Ghetto Spread.
- Scaffold adapters:
  - `TradeLockerAdapter` (forex; TrendMarkets broker config).
  - `TradierAdapter` (options now; futures behind a feature flag).
- Wire Polygon flat-file loaders; standardize logs ingestion (include trades.html).
- Stand up run/evaluation view with agreed KPIs and promotion gates.

- We’ll proceed with single TradeLocker adapter (TrendMarkets broker), prep Tradier futures behind a feature flag, note IBKR for later, and Option A will scale cleanly into Option C.

**User**

ok, what else do you need from me?  

---

**Cursor**

Quick status: I’m ready to scaffold Option A (Agent SDK subagents), seed ZRCE + Ghetto Spread, and wire Tradier + TradeLocker/Trend with Polygon flat-file backtests. Here’s what I need from you to move fast.

### What I need from you
- Broker access
  - Tradier: account type(s) and keys for options (and futures when enabled), paper/live accounts.
  - TradeLocker/Trend: environment URL, username, password, server, and any API key; confirm single adapter with TrendMarkets as broker behind TradeLocker.
- Repo and environment
  - Target repo/path to scaffold (branch name is fine).
  - Python version and venv/conda preference; approve `pyarrow`, `pandas`, `polars` in requirements.
  - Keep `credentials.py` + `.env` pattern from `StrategyTemplate.py`? If yes, share current `credentials.py` stub (sans secrets).
- Data for backtests (Polygon flat files)
  - Base folder path(s) and filename patterns for `options_min`, `equities_min`, `equities_5min`.
  - One small parquet sample per type so I can auto-detect schema (columns, timezone).
- Strategy seeds and universes
  - Confirm first two specs: ZRCE Second Chance (SPY options) and Ghetto Spread (AMD calls; staged debit spread).
  - Initial universes:
    - Options: list of underlyings (e.g., SPY, QQQ, AMD).
    - Forex: pairs to start (e.g., XAUUSD, EURUSD, NAS100/US30 via Trend).
    - Futures: micros to support first (MES, MNQ, M2K, MGC, MYM).
- Signals integration
  - Approve using `kirkland_signals.csv` to create a “Signals” strategy family. Confirm field mapping for entries/exits (e.g., action→direction, symbol normalization, TP levels).
- KPIs and promotion
  - You approved defaults (DD ≤ 20%, Sharpe ≥ 0.8, win rate ≥ 55%, trades ≥ 100). Confirm demo promotion window (e.g., rolling 20 trading days) and manual approval for live.
- Logs ingestion
  - Confirm logs folder to ingest (tearsheet.csv/html, trades.csv/html, stats.csv, settings.json). I’ll standardize run folders and filename parsing.
- UI scope
  - MVP preference: CLI + simple Streamlit dashboard, or FastAPI backend + minimal web UI? Pick one for week 1.
- IBKR note
  - I’ll add “IBKR adapter” to backlog for futures/options as future enhancement.

If you drop the above items (or as many as you have now), I’ll scaffold the repo, commit Strategy Spec v1, create broker adapters (Tradier, TradeLocker/Trend), plug Polygon loaders, and stand up subagent stubs.

- I’ll scale Option A into Option C later without rework (same artifacts and roles).
- Tradier futures tracked; will feature-flag until enabled per their futures page: [Tradier futures margins](https://tradier.com/individuals/pricing/futures-margins).

**User**

i want start a new project. can you create a document that will be the starting place ind the new project/repo

---

**Cursor**

Brief status: I’ll give you a single “start-here” document you can drop into the new repo root as README.md (or START_HERE.md). It reflects subagents (Option A), Strategy Spec v1, Tradier + TradeLocker/Trend, Polygon flat files, logs/KPIs, and scales to Option C later.

### Suggested file: README.md

```markdown
## Algo Platform — Start Here

A spec-first, multi-agent platform that designs, backtests, and deploys trading strategies across options, futures (micros), and forex using Lumibot. Subagents coordinate research → spec → code → backtest → evaluate → fix → deploy. Built to scale from simple file orchestration to a full DAG/evaluation harness.

- Agent role pattern inspiration: contains-studio/agents (subagent definitions) [link](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)
- Tradier futures margins reference (feature-gated at start) [link](https://tradier.com/individuals/pricing/futures-margins)

### 1) Architecture (Option A, scalable to Option C)
- Subagents: Researcher → Strategy Architect → Lumibot Coder → Backtest Runner → Evaluator → Fixer → Deployer
- Artifacts per run: strategy_spec.json, lumibot_strategy.py, runner config, results (settings.json, tearsheet.csv/html, trades.csv/html, stats.csv)
- Scale path: keep same artifacts and add a DAG that runs grids, regression tests, and promotion gates

### 2) Strategy Spec v1 (JSON, single source of truth)
- Core keys
  - name, slug, universe, timeframe
  - entry: signal_logic, timing, triggers
  - legs: option/future/forex legs; right/side/delta/dte/width/qty
  - risk_exits: stop/tp/trailing/time-exit/roll
  - sizing: per-trade risk or debit/contract caps
  - data: source=polygon_flat; paths for equities_min, equities_5min, options_min; tz
  - broker: tradier | tradelocker (TrendMarkets); account_type (paper|live)
  - backtest: start, end, cash, fees, benchmark, outputs
- Minimal skeleton:

### 5) Broker adapters
- Tradier adapter
  - Options now; Futures behind feature flag until enabled per your account (micros: MES, MNQ, M2K, MGC, MYM)
  - Backlog: IBKR adapter for futures/options
- TradeLocker adapter (single adapter; TrendMarkets as broker)
  - Parametrize env/server; supports forex symbols (e.g., XAUUSD, EURUSD, NAS100, US30)

### 6) Data (Polygon flat files)
- Backtests read minute/5-minute parquet via libs/lumibot_helpers/polygon_io.py
- Ensure columns: open, high, low, close, volume, timestamp (tz-aware NY time preferred)
- Options parquet: must include ticker, underlying, expiration, close (minute)

### 7) Seed strategies
- ZRCE Second Chance (SPY options): zone-based entry, second-chance confirmation, TP/SL/trailing/time-exit
- Ghetto Spread (AMD calls): staged debit spread (long call → convert by selling OTM call on trigger)
- Later: “Signals” family from kirkland_signals.csv (forex/futures indices via TradeLocker/Trend)

### 8) Run flows
- Generate/curate spec → agents/runner.py executes backtest
```bash
python agents/runner.py --spec strategies/zrce_second_chance/strategy_spec.json
```
- Outputs saved in strategies/{slug}/results/{run_id}/ with:
  - settings.json, tearsheet.csv/html, trades.csv/html, stats.csv
- Evaluator checks KPIs:
  - max_drawdown <= 20%, sharpe >= 0.8, win_rate >= 55%, trades >= 100
- Promotion:
  - If KPIs sustained over a rolling window (e.g., 20 trading days), mark for demo
  - Live requires manual approval

### 9) Logs and observability
- Ingest lumibot outputs including trades.html
- Normalize filenames to a runs registry (CSV/SQLite/Parquet)
- Minimal dashboard (Streamlit or FastAPI+simple UI) to list runs, KPIs, drill to trades/tearsheet

### 10) Roadmap (extracts)
- Short term
  - Finalize Strategy Spec v1 + subagent stubs (OpenAI Agent SDK)
  - Polygon parquet loaders; ZRCE + Ghetto Spread live in repo
  - Tradier options, TradeLocker/Trend forex adapter
- Mid term
  - Tradier futures feature flag → enable when account ready
  - Signals ingestion from kirkland_signals.csv (forex/futures micros)
  - Promotion gates and basic scheduling for demo
- Long term (Option C)
  - DAG + grid backtests + regression suite
  - IBKR adapter
  - Advanced UI and multi-strategy portfolio evaluation

### 11) Contribution and governance
- Specs are canonical; code must be generated/edited to conform
- Every run persists artifacts; reproducibility required before promotion

### 12) Disclaimers
- Trading involves substantial risk. Use paper/demo until strategies meet KPIs and pass review.

If you prefer, save as START_HERE.md and we’ll keep README.md concise with a link.

- Document includes subagent flow, Strategy Spec v1 skeleton, repo layout, setup, adapters (Tradier, TradeLocker/Trend), Polygon flat files, logs/KPIs, seed strategies, roadmap, and links to contains-studio/agents and Tradier futures margins.
- Ready to scaffold the repo using this as the root README.

## Algo Platform — Start Here

A spec-first, multi-agent platform that designs, backtests, and deploys trading strategies across options, futures (micros), and forex using Lumibot. Subagents coordinate research → spec → code → backtest → evaluate → fix → deploy. Built to scale from simple file orchestration to a full DAG/evaluation harness.

- Agent role pattern inspiration: contains-studio/agents (subagent definitions) [link](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)
- Tradier futures margins reference (feature-gated at start) [link](https://tradier.com/individuals/pricing/futures-margins)

### 1) Architecture (Option A, scalable to Option C)
- Subagents: Researcher → Strategy Architect → Lumibot Coder → Backtest Runner → Evaluator → Fixer → Deployer
- Artifacts per run: strategy_spec.json, lumibot_strategy.py, runner config, results (settings.json, tearsheet.csv/html, trades.csv/html, stats.csv)
- Scale path: keep same artifacts and add a DAG that runs grids, regression tests, and promotion gates

### 2) Strategy Spec v1 (JSON, single source of truth)
- Core keys
  - name, slug, universe, timeframe
  - entry: signal_logic, timing, triggers
  - legs: option/future/forex legs; right/side/delta/dte/width/qty
  - risk_exits: stop/tp/trailing/time-exit/roll
  - sizing: per-trade risk or debit/contract caps
  - data: source=polygon_flat; paths for equities_min, equities_5min, options_min; tz
  - broker: tradier | tradelocker (TrendMarkets); account_type (paper|live)
  - backtest: start, end, cash, fees, benchmark, outputs
- Minimal skeleton:
```json

**User**

how do you want to keep track of tasks or  one of the sub agents whil handle that?

---

**Cursor**

Brief status: I’ll propose a simple, durable task system that works now (file-based), plugs into the subagent flow, and can later be mirrored to Issues/Projects without rework.

### Recommended task tracking
- - **Single source of truth (repo-local)**
  - `ops/tasks.json` as a canonical queue.
  - States: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`.
  - Fields: `id`, `type`, `strategy_slug`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `dependencies`, `assigned_agent`, `priority`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `tags`.

- - **Agent ownership**
  - A lightweight “Coordinator” subagent reads/writes `ops/tasks.json`.
  - Each subagent (Researcher/Architect/Coder/Runner/Evaluator/Fixer/Deployer) pulls tasks it owns, updates status, and appends artifacts paths.
  - Runner/Evaluator auto-create “fix” tasks when errors/KPI failures occur.

- - **Artifacts linkage**
  - Tasks reference `runs/{uuid}/` artifacts and `strategies/{slug}/` paths.
  - Errors and logs (including `trades.html`) are attached via file paths.

- - **Human control and audit**
  - Simple CLI: `python ops/cli.py add|ls|assign|start|block|review|done --id ...`
  - Commit messages include `Task: <id>` for traceability.
  - Optional: mirror to GitHub Issues later; task `id` can map to issue number.

### Minimal JSON schema
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T-2025-0001",
      "type": "generate_spec|code|backtest|evaluate|fix|deploy",
      "strategy_slug": "zrce_second_chance",
      "assigned_agent": "architect|coder|runner|evaluator|fixer|deployer",
      "priority": "P1|P2|P3",
      "state": "todo|in_progress|blocked|review|done",
      "dependencies": ["T-2025-0000"],
      "inputs": {"spec_path": "strategies/zrce_second_chance/strategy_spec.json"},
      "outputs": {"run_dir": "strategies/zrce_second_chance/results/2025-..."},
      "created_at": "2025-07-08T12:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-07-08T12:00:00Z",
      "tags": ["options","tradier"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Optional integrations (later)
- Sync with GitHub Issues/Projects; keep `ops/tasks.json` as the ground truth.
- Add a tiny SQLite store if concurrency grows; same fields.

Answer to your question: yes, one subagent (Coordinator) will manage the queue, but we’ll keep a repo-local `ops/tasks.json` so humans and automation share the same task list.

- Coordinator subagent manages `ops/tasks.json`; agents update status and attach artifacts.
- File-based now; can mirror to GitHub Issues later without changing flows.
- Auto “fix” tasks created from Runner/Evaluator errors and KPI failures.

      "assigned_agent": "architect|coder|runner|evaluator|fixer|deployer",
      "priority": "P1|P2|P3",
      "state": "todo|in_progress|blocked|review|done",
